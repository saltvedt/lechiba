# Lechiba

## Rules of Game

Agents can move one tile in any direction once per step. Agents have sight range.

Leopards score points by eating Chimps. Leopards can turn invisble when not moving.

Chimps score points by eating bananas. Chimps can tell every other chimp on the board what they see (or lie about it!).

Bananas are eaten by Chimps. They regenerate every X steps.

## Installation

Clone, run bundle install, then run:

    $ ruby lib/lechiba.rb

## How to Play

Create a smart Chimp class.
